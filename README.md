# Market basket analysis
Market basket analysis is all about - analyzing the association among products bought together by customers. Market basket analysis is a versatile use case in the retail industry that helps cross-sell products in a physical outlet and also helps e-commerce businesses recommend products to customers based on product associations. Apriori and FP growth are the most popular machine learning algorithms used for association learning to perform market basket analysis.

# Apriori Algorithm
Apriori algorithm is given by R. Agrawal and R. Srikant in 1994 for finding frequent itemsets in a dataset for boolean association rule. Name of the algorithm is Apriori because it uses prior knowledge of frequent itemset properties. We apply an iterative approach or level-wise search where k-frequent itemsets are used to find k+1 itemsets.
